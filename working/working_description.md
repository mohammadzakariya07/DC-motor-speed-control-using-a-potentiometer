## Working of the Project

1. The potentiometer is connected to the analog pin A0.
2. Arduino reads the analog value (0–1023).
3. The value is mapped to PWM range (0–255).
4. PWM signal is applied to the motor driver.
5. Motor speed changes according to potentiometer rotation.
6. Values are displayed on the Serial Monitor.
